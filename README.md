# X-Invoice-Generator

_Eine deutschsprachige [README](https://gitlab.com/l3montree/x-invoice/x-invoice-generator/-/blob/master/README_DE.md) kann hier gefunden werden._

Welcome! This is the place where an open and free generator for X-Invoices is created. According to the decision of the IT Planning Council of June 22nd, 2017, X-Invoices are decisive for the implementation of Directive 2014/55/EU in Germany. This generator tries to implement the specifications in a simple and open way and to make them easy to use for everyone.

Main technical reference (e.g. specs for types of fields) is the official standard in Version 2.0.0 (30.06.2020). You can download the german document [here](https://www.xoev.de/sixcms/media.php/13/200-XRechnung-2020-06-30.pdf).

The used syntax is UBL (Universal Business Language). Basically there is still the CII syntax, but it is less powerful. Documentation of the syntax is available from PEPPOL - [link](https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/billing/3.0/syntax/ubl-invoice/tree/).

This software is developed by [l3montree](https://l3montree.com), on the initiative of [Neuland@Homeland GmbH](https://neuland-homeland.de), open to contributions and input from anyone.

## Download and install

You can download the software from the [release](https://gitlab.com/l3montree/x-invoice/x-invoice-generator/-/releases) page. There are packed installers for Windows (64-bit exe), Linux (amd64 for Debian) and OS X (dmg) available.

### Start & Develop

1. Clone the project.
2. Go into your project-directory.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run the application in development mode: `npm run dev`

If you need more details just have a look at the `package.json` file.

### Mapping of a specific invoice template

The structure of the project is intended to make it easy to adopt the basic standard for specific cases. In the project, the specifications of the standard are therefore mapped in UBL syntax. Since different organizations or companies usually only need specific fields of an invoice they can be used easily from the basic standard. An example for the specifications of the **"Deutsche Bahn"** can be found in the [Wiki](<https://gitlab.com/l3montree/x-invoice-generator/-/wikis/documentation/specific_requirements_XInvoice/Deutsche_Bahn/Deutsche_Bahn_XInvoice_Requirements_(UBL)>). The current version [v0.0.1](https://gitlab.com/l3montree/x-invoice/x-invoice-generator/-/releases) is especially designed to fit the requirements of the **"Deutsche Bahn"**. Further information regarding X-Invoices and **"Deutsche Bahn"** can be found at their [FAQ](https://www.deutschebahn.com/de/geschaefte/lieferantenportal/informationsservice/FAQs-rund-um-das-Thema-Rechnungsstellung-5570102).

### Example X-Invoices

You can download example X-Invoices in UBL and CII Standard [here](https://basket.l3montree.com/s/BwpsnCQRTfiRckW).
